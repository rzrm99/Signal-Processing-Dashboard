# Signal-Processing-Dashboard

# Signal Processing Dashboard (PyQt + Matplotlib)

A fully interactive signal processing dashboard built with **PyQt5** and **Matplotlib**, supporting real-time filtering, visualization, and analysis of signals loaded from CSV files.

## üìå Features

- ‚úÖ Load signals from `.csv` files (`time, amplitude`)
- ‚úÖ Visualize original and filtered signals
- ‚úÖ Real-time filter updates as parameters change
- ‚úÖ Support for multiple filter families:
  - Butterworth
  - Bessel
  - Chebyshev I
  - Chebyshev II
  - Elliptic
  - Custom (user-defined `b`, `a` coefficients)
- ‚úÖ Adjustable parameters:
  - Filter type (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass)
  - Cutoff frequencies
  - Filter order
  - Ripple (for Chebyshev/elliptic)
  - Attenuation (for Chebyshev II/elliptic)
- ‚úÖ Interactive zoom and pan (via matplotlib toolbar)
- ‚úÖ Reset zoom button
- ‚úÖ Toggle to show/hide original signal

## üß™ Example Signals

You can generate test signals like sine, square, sawtooth, or noisy waveforms and save them in CSV format using the included generator script (see `generate_signals.py`).

CSV format expected:

```csv
time,amplitude
0.000,0.00
0.001,0.31
...
